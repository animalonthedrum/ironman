// These paths are setup to work when deployed to our S3 buckets.
// We have also modified SNAP to route the `latest` url path
// to the appropriate files when serving locally with `snap serve`.

// NOTE: If you use the `inline-image` compass helper, don't use these variables.
//       Instead use the full path, like `inline-image('themes/assets/fonts/img.svg')`.

$shared-image-path: "../images/se-ui";
$shared-font-path: "../../assets/latest/fonts";
